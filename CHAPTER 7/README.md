#### THE C PREPROCESSOR:


THE C PREPROCESSOR IS A MACRO PROCESSOR THAT IS USED AUTOMATICALLY BY THE C COMPILER TO TRANSFORM YOUR PROGRAM BEFORE ACTUAL COMPILATION (PROPROCESSOR DIRECIVES ARE EXECUTED BEFORE COMPILATION.). IT IS CALLED A MACRO PROCESSOR BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOU TO DEFINE MACROS, WHICH ARE BRIEF ABBREVIATIONS FOR LONGER CONSTRUCTS.
