#### USER-DEFINED CODES FOR FEW BUILT IN FUNCTIONS:


_IN THIS I HAVE CODE'S OF ADDITIONAL CONCEPTS OF DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCTION AND MANUALLY CRAETED FUNCTIONS OF BULT-IN STRING FUNCTIONS_

**=>** CALLOC: 
```
THE "calloc()" FUNCTION IN C IS USED TO ALLOCATE A SPECIFIED AMOUNT OF MEMORY AND THEN INITIALIZE IT TO ZERO. THE FUNCTION 
RETURNS A VOID POINTER TO THIS MEMORY LOCATION, WHICH CAN THEN BE CAST TO THE DESIRED TYPE. THE FUNCTION TAKES IN TWO 
PARAMETERS THAT COLLECTIVELY SPECIFY THE AMOUNT OF MEMORY TO BE ALLOCATED.
```

**=>** MALLOC: 
```
THE “malloc()" OR “MEMORY ALLOCATION” METHOD IN C IS USED TO DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATE A SINGLE LARGE BLOCK OF MEMORY WITH THE 
SPECIFIED SIZE. IT RETURNS A POINTER OF TYPE VOID WHICH CAN BE CAST INTO A POINTER OF ANY FORM.
```

**=>** REALLOC: 
```
IN THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, THE "realloc()" FUNCTION IS USED TO RESIZE A BLOCK OF MEMORY THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED. THE
"realloc()" FUNCTION ALLOCATES A BLOCK OF MEMORY (WHICH BE CAN MAKE IT LARGER OR SMALLER IN SIZE THAN THE ORIGINAL) AND COPIES
THE CONTENTS OF THE OLD BLOCK TO THE NEW BLOCK OF MEMORY, IF NECESSARY.
```

**=>** FREE: 
```
THE "free()" FUNCTION IN C LIBRARY ALLOWS YOU TO RELEASE OR DEALLOCATE THE MEMORY BLOCKS WHICH ARE PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED BY 
"calloc()", "malloc()" OR "realloc()" FUNCTIONS. IT FREES UP THE MEMORY BLOCKS AND RETURNS THE MEMORY TO HEAP.FOR DYNAMIC 
MEMORY ALLOCATION IN C, YOU HAVE TO DEALLOCATE THE MEMORY EXPLICITLY.
```
