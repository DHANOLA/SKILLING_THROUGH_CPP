#### CODE EXAMPLES FOR FUNCTION OVERLOADING, OPERATOR OVERLOADING & THIS KEYWORD:


_IN THIS I HAVE ADDED CODE EXAMPLES FOR FUNCTION OVERLOADING, OPERATOR OVERLOADING AND THIS POINTER_

**=>** FUNCTION OVERLOADING: 
```
C++ ALLOWS SPECIFICATION OF MORE THAN ONE FUNCTION OF THE SAME NAME IN THE SAME SCOPE. THESE FUNCTIONS ARE CALLED 
"OVERLOADED FUNCTIONS". "OVERLOADED FUNCTIONS" ENABLE YOU TO SUPPLY DIFFERENT SEMANTICS FOR A FUNCTION, DEPENDING
ON THE TYPES AND NUMBER OF ARGUMENTS.
```

**=>** OPERATOR OVERLOADING: 
```
C++ HAS THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE OPERATORS WITH A SPECIAL MEANING FOR A DATA TYPE, THIS ABILITY IS KNOWN AS 
"OPERATOR OVERLOADING". FOR EXAMPLE, WE CAN OVERLOAD AN OPERATOR '+' IN A CLASS LIKE STRING SO THAT WE CAN 
CONCATENATE TWO STRINGS BY JUST USING +.
```

**=>** THIS KEYWORD: 
```
IN C++ PROGRAMMING, "this" IS A KEYWORD THAT REFERS TO THE CURRENT INSTANCE OF THE CLASS. THERE CAN BE 3 MAIN 
USAGE OF "this" KEYWORD IN C++.

1. IT CAN BE USED TO PASS CURRENT OBJECT AS A PARAMETER TO ANOTHER METHOD.
2. IT CAN BE USED TO REFER CURRENT CLASS INSTANCE VARIABLE.
3. IT CAN BE USED TO DECLARE INDEXERS.
```
